# myProps

## Description

myProps is a website built for property managers to easily keep track of properties that they manage. myProps goal is to keep information private to the user, so nobody else has access to their information. Accessability is key as well, as we want our users to get a feel for the website and make navigation easygoing for their experience.

myProps allows managers to add a listing(property that they manage), they can add information regarding; rental price, pets, tenants, and details about the property itself.

myProps also allows managers to keep track of work requests. It's important to keep a record of ongoing or previous work requests to a listing, as it could potentially arise in the future again and managers can have a log to refer back to.

Lastly, myProps allows managers to keep a log of previous and current tenants that occupy/occupied their property, just to keep in contact.
